This healthcare project which i have created is based on AI/ML model . The model will be used to predict the disease along with description of the disease , workouts to be done , a good diet , precautions along with medications.
In the code part which is in HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM.ipynb you can see there will be print(list(dataset.columns)) here it prints all the symptoms this model and process.
Perform the function of the prototype from HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM.ipynb (just go at last and in second last block of code re run it then enter the symptoms based on the print(list(dataset.columns) and it will predict the  disease, description of the disease,precautions,medications,WORKOUTS and diets.
Use this and let me know how you felt about this model. THANK YOU!!
